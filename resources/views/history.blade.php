                              25th years ago Phaung Daw Oo monastic education school was established by the two brothers, Ven Nayaka and Ven Jotika. During eight years times the school has been developed from primary to high school level: In 1993 Primary, In 1998 Secondary, In 2000 High School. In 2011 the principal and his colleagues attended an annual conference of International Network of Engage Buddhist (INEB). The conference gave him a chance to study about Santiniketan University founded by Rabindra Nath Tagore which has the education programs start from Kindergarten to PhD level. It inspired him to establish a University. When he came back he steps forward to upgrade his school to university. In 2013 the principal and his colleagues were invited from Australian Education Institutions, primary schools and universities. There, he took chance to affiliate with Australian Catholic University (ACU). 15 students from Phaung Daw Oo High School were sent to study in ACU for education in Diploma. In 2014 A well-wishers donated 450 acres land near Mandalay to establish a university. Meanwhile the Phaung Daw Oo School tries to link with some Western Universities like American University (AU), Menandar University, Hamsted University, Victoria University, and University of Melbourne. Students were sent to theses universities to study MA program, BA program and Intensive courses. In 2017_2018 the Eastern Universities also came and joined the school to work education matter together: Foguang Shan University from Taiwan and International Buddhist College (IBC) from Thailand. On January 25, 2019, the PIU signed a higher academic cooperation agreement with IBC in Mandalay.

                            <h4>History Of University</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                              As the education in Myanmar is lasting behind so do every aspect of Myanmar. Therefore, it is desperately needed to lift the status of education in Myanmar. We can see that the countries which have internationally high ranking universities become well developed ones in the world. To establish quality assurance university qualify teachers and eligible students are needed. As Myanmar has been deteriorating for many years qualify teachers are very difficult to have. So, no eligible students become. I have been facing this broken process of education system for over a decade. Good quality university students have to become from good quality basic education level students i.e primary, secondary, and tertiary. Taking the help from international education aid organization I have provided numbers of teacher trainings, from which quality teachers were produced. I hope those quality teachers will reproduce eligible students. In fact, this education reform process is just for basic education level. Now it is time for university level. I believe Phaung Daw Oo International University will become the international standard one.
